These user stories capture typical real-world use cases for fastspa features.

## Network centrality metrics

- **As a policy analyst**, I need to identify bottleneck sectors (high betweenness centrality) so that I can prioritise interventions where disruptions or decarbonisation measures will propagate most effectively.
- **As a supply-chain risk analyst**, I need network topology summaries (density, in/out strength) so that I can compare how structurally concentrated different target-sector supply chains are.

## Uncertainty quantification

- **As an academic researcher**, I need Monte Carlo uncertainty bounds on sector contributions so that I can report confidence intervals and avoid over-interpreting point estimates.
- **As a model developer**, I need Latin Hypercube Sampling so that I can achieve stable uncertainty estimates with fewer model runs.
- **As a practitioner**, I need sensitivity elasticities so that I can understand which input intensities dominate the reported total impact.

## Consequential & policy scenario analysis

- **As a policy analyst**, I need to run perturbation (consequential) scenarios so that I can quantify how proposed interventions change total impacts and upstream hotspots.

## Temporal & dynamic analysis

- **As a researcher**, I need to compare SPA results across multiple years so that I can identify whether supply-chain hotspots are structurally changing over time.

## Loop detection & circular economy analysis

- **As a circular economy analyst**, I need explicit loop detection so that I can identify self-reinforcing cycles and discuss feedback dynamics in system-wide supply chains.

## Semantic aggregation

- **As an LCA practitioner**, I need to aggregate granular IO sectors into stakeholder-friendly groupings so that I can communicate results without exposing proprietary or overly detailed sector classifications.
- **As a government reporting team**, I need hierarchical aggregation (e.g. division → group → industry) so that I can publish results aligned to standard statistical classifications.
